## Dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # localhost:5173
npm run build     # outputs to dist/
npm run preview   # preview the build
```

## Asset Organization

```
public/           # Vite static assets (served at /)
  Media/          # Team photos and images
  Docs/           # PDFs (manifesto, etc.)
Media/            # Source copies of media files
```

> Team photos go in `public/Media/`. Vite serves `public/` at the root URL.

## RSS Feeds (Research & Writing)

The home page pulls live posts from multiple RSS feeds:

- Substack feeds (Avi Parrack, Saheb Gulati)
- EA Forum user feeds

Feed sources are configured in `index.html` under `RSS_FEEDS`. Deduplication logic filters cross-posts between Substack and EA Forum, preferring Substack when both exist.

To add a new feed:
```js
{ url: 'https://...', source: 'Substack' | 'EA Forum', author: 'Name', defaultImage: '...' }
```

## Adding Team Members

1. Add photo to `public/Media/` (convert `.heic` to `.jpg` first — `sips -s format jpeg input.heic --out output.jpg`)
2. Add a member card in `community.html` following the existing card pattern
